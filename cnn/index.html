                    <h2>All our recent progress with Covid-19 could be wiped out by variants, CDC director says. 'Please stay strong'</h2>

                    <p>(CNN)The US is at risk of losing all its recent gains in the battle against Covid-19 as highly contagious variants take advantage of Americans getting lax with safety measures.
                        "Please hear me clearly: At this level of cases with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained," said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
                        After weeks of tumbling case numbers, new infections are on the rise again -- about 2% more this past week compared to the previous week, Walensky said Monday.
                        "Similarly, the most recent seven-day average of deaths has also increased more than 2% ... to nearly 2,000 deaths per day."
                        Walensky also called out states that were easing up on Covid-19 safety mandates.
                        "I am really worried about reports that more states are rolling back the exact public health measures we have recommended to protect people from Covid-19," she said.
                        "Please stay strong in your conviction. Continue wearing your well-fitting mask and taking the other public health prevention actions that we know work," Walensky added.
                        "Ultimately, vaccination is what will bring us out of this pandemic. To get there, we need to vaccinate many more people."</p>

                    <h2>Rare Winston Churchill painting sold by Angelina Jolie smashes auction record</h2>
                    <h6>Written by <br />Jacqui Palumbo, CNN <br />Published 2nd March 2021</h6>
                    <div id="img2"><img src="images/winston-churchill-painting.png" alt="Winsten Churchill Painting"></div>
                    <p>
                        Arare Winston Churchill painting that was gifted to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and eventually made its way into actor Angelina Jolie's collection has become the most expensive painting by the former British prime minister to sell at auction, fetching nearly £8.3 million ($11.5 million) after fees.<br />
                        The work, "Tower of Koutoubia Mosque," was sold March 1 by the Jolie Family Collection and features the long shadows and warm tones of a sunset in Marrakech, Morroco -- a favorite subject of Churchill's to paint.<br />
                        "Churchill first visited Morocco in 1935 where he fell in love with the quality of light there," said Nick Orchard, head of modern British art at Christie's in London, where the auction took place. "He felt that his paintings of the country were among his best." <br />
                        The sale more than tripled its high estimate of £2.5 million ($3.5 million). Churchill's previous record was £1.7 million ($2.7 million) in 2014 at Sotheby's London.<br />
                        According to a source with knowledge of sale, actor Brad Pitt bought Churchill's sunset scene as a gift to Jolie in 2011. The couple separated in 2016 after two years of marriage.<br />
                        "Tower of Koutoubia Mosque" is the only painting that Churchill made between 1939 and 1945, during World War II.<br />
                        In January of 1943, after jointly attending the Casablanca Conference in Morroco to strategize against Nazi Germany, Churchill convinced Roosevelt to join him in nearby Marrakech and watch the sun drop behind the Atlas Mountains. Their brief sojourn together was memorialized by the painting, which Churchill created the very next day following Roosevelt's departure. After the conference, the two leaders demanded "unconditional surrender" from Germany, Italy and Japan -- a historic declaration that had a far-reaching impact on the war.<br />
                        Pitt purchased the painting from antiques dealer Bill Rau, who previously told CNN President Roosevelt's son had sold the piece to a filmmaker in the 1960s. According to Rau, the painting eventually ended up in New Orleans, where it was kept in a local family's closet for more than five decades before a family member contacted his gallery, M.S. Rau.<br />
                        "The painting depicts the very moment the two world leaders shared as they viewed the majestic landscape of Marrakech as the sun set over the Atlas Mountains, and to know Churchill gifted the painting to FDR after their time together excited me even more," Rau said.<br />
                        Churchill began painting well into adulthood, around age 40, following a failed naval attack during World War I that cost him his title of First Lord of the Admiralty. Nevertheless, he was prolific, producing over 500 works in his lifetime.<br />
                        The market for the former prime minister's art only continues to grow. In addition to "Tower of Koutoubia Mosque," two other works of his overperformed at the Christie's "Modern British Art" evening sale.<br />
                        "Scene at Marrakech," another light-filled composition of Churchill's favorite place, went for close to £1.9 million ($2.6 million), and "St Paul's Churchyard," sold at nearly £1.1 million ($1.5 million). Both sale prices were more than triple their high estimates.<br />
                        "The appetite for Winston Churchill's artwork was demonstrated to great effect at Christie's," Orchard said.

                    <h2>Rare 'locked' letter sealed 300 years ago is finally opened virtually</h2>
                    <h6>Written by Katie Hunt, CNN <br />Published 2nd March 2021</h6>
                    <div id="img3"><img src="images/sealed-letters.png" alt="Sealed Letters"></div>
                    <p>
                        Three hundred years ago, before envelopes, passwords and security codes, writers often struggled to keep thoughts, cares and dreams expressed in their letters private.<br />
                        One popular way was to use a technique called letter locking -- intricately folding a flat sheet of paper to become its own envelope. This security strategy presented a challenge when 577 locked letters delivered to The Hague in the Netherlands between 1689 and 1706 were found in a trunk of undelivered mail.<br />
                        The letters had never reached their final recipients, and conservationists didn't want to open and damage them. Instead, a team has found a way to read one of the letters without breaking its seal or unfolding it in any way. Using a highly sensitive X-ray scanner and computer algorithms, researchers virtually unfolded the unopened letter.<br />
                        "This algorithm takes us right into the heart of a locked letter," the research team said in a statement.<br />
                        "Sometimes the past resists scrutiny. We could simply have cut these letters open, but instead we took the time to study them for their hidden, secret, and inaccessible qualities. We've learned that letters can be a lot more revealing when they are left unopened."<br />
                        The technique revealed the contents of a letter dated July 31, 1697. It contains a request from Jacques Sennacques to his cousin Pierre Le Pers, a French merchant in The Hague, for a certified copy of a death notice of Daniel Le Pers.<br />
                        The details may seem prosaic, but the researchers said the letter gives fascinating insight into the lives of ordinary people -- a snapshot of the early modern world as it went about its business.<br />
                        The trunk of correspondence belonged to a postmaster called Simon de Brienne and his wife, postmistress Marie Germain. It was acquired by the Museum voor Communicatie in The Hague in 1926.<br />
                        In addition to the unopened letters, it contains 2,571 opened letters and fragments that for one reason or another never reached their destination.<br />
                        At that time, there was no such thing as a postage stamp and recipients, not senders, were responsible for the postal and delivery charges. If the recipient was deceased or rejected the letter, no fees could be collected and the letters weren't delivered.
